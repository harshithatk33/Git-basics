# Git-basics
Learning git and github basics from scratch.


1. "git add" - saving changes
Moves changes from the working directory to the staging area. This gives you the opportunity to prepare a snapshot before committing it to the official history.

2. "git branch" - to use branches
This command is your general-purpose branch administration tool. It lets you create isolated development environments within a single repository.

3. "git checkout" -
In addition to checking out old commits and old file revisions, git checkout is also the means to navigate existing branches. Combined with the basic Git commands, itâ€™s a way to work on a particular line of development.

4. "git clean" - Removes untracked files from the working directory. This is the logical counterpart to git reset, which (typically) only operates on tracked files.

5. "git clone _repository_"
Creates a copy of an existing Git repository. Cloning is the most common way for developers to obtain a working copy of a central repository.

6. "git commit" - Captures the staged snapshot and commits it to the project history. Combined with git add, this defines the basic workflow for all Git users.

7. "git fetch" - Initializes a new Git repository. If you want to place a project under revision control, this is the first command you need to learn.

8. "git log" - Shows the entire git projects previous revisions with display of various commits done to that project.

9. "git merge" - A powerful way to integrate changes from divergent branches. After forking the project history with git branch, git merge lets you put it back together again.

10. "git pull" - Pulling is the automated version of git fetch. It downloads a branch from a remote repository, then immediately merges it into the current branch. This is the Git equivalent of svn update.

11. "git push" - Pushing is the opposite of fetching (with a few caveats). It lets you move a local branch to another repository, which serves as a convenient way to publish contributions.
