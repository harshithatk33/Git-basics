# Git-basics
Learning git and github basics from scratch.

1. "git add" - saving changes
Moves changes from the working directory to the staging area. This gives you the opportunity to prepare a snapshot before committing it to the official history.

2. "git branch" - to use branches
This command is your general-purpose branch administration tool. It lets you create isolated development environments within a single repository.
